                >Introduction to the Fundamental Role of Electricity in
                Computing</strong
              ><br />
              Electricity is fundamental to the operation of all electronic
              devices, including computers. This write-up explores the basic
              principles of electricity flow and how these principles underpin
              modern computing.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> Binary States of Electricity</strong> <br />Electricity
              flows through wires to power various devices. This flow can be in
              one of two states: ON or OFF. For instance, switches are used to
              control lights by turning them on or off. These switches act as
              controllers; when turned on, they allow electricity to flow to the
              light, illuminating it.

              <strong> Visualization of Binary Operations</strong><br />
              Consider the two images on the right. The first image shows
              flashing lights forming a moving circle, commonly seen at festive
              occasions. The second image depicts an equalizer, similar to what
              we observe when playing music. These visual effects are familiar,
              but understanding their operation reveals fundamental principles
              of computer science. Focusing on a single light in the moving
              circle reveals that each light turns on and off or changes color
              without moving. Each light operates on a timed interval, creating
              the illusion of movement when viewed as a whole. Similarly, the
              equalizerâ€™s bars appear to move up and down, but this effect is
              created by individual lights turning on and off at intervals.
              These patterns are controlled by circuits, which are essentially
              electronic switches.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> Circuits and Computer Motherboards</strong> <br />
              In engineering, these controllers are called circuits. Computers
              contain thousands of such circuits to perform various tasks. These
              circuits are arranged on motherboards, which are complex boards
              containing numerous circuits and their connections. The
              fundamental principle of these circuits remains the same: they
              control the flow of electricity, which can be in an ON (1) or OFF
              (0) state. It is important to note that this (0, 1) representation
              is also known as binary systems or low-level machine code.

              <strong> Programming and Binary Instructions</strong><br />

              Since manually controlling each switch in a circuit is
              impractical, scientists and engineers developed ways to automate
              these controls using instructions. Initially, these instructions
              were written in low-level machine code (using 0s and 1s) to
              directly manipulate the hardware. Over time, these
              <span class="highlight highlight-purple">instructions</span>
              evolved into more sophisticated, human-readable
              <span class="highlight highlight-yellow"
                >programming languages,</span
              >
              enabling more complex and abstract software development.
              <span class="highlight highlight-purple">Compilers</span> were
              created to translate these high-level programming languages into
              <span class="highlight highlight-yellow"
                >low-level machine code.</span
              >
              <br /><br />
              Early computers were programmed using binary instructions, with
              operations represented by sequences of 0s (OFF) and 1s (ON).
              Despite their complexity, modern computers still rely on this
              fundamental principle. They execute instructions by controlling
              the flow of electricity, creating intricate operations from simple
              binary states. This principle underlies everything from basic
              visual effects to sophisticated software applications.
              <br /><br />
              Today, there are many programming languages available, each with
              its own strengths and efficiencies for processing specific tasks.
              These languages make it easier for humans to write programs, and
              the compilers ensure that the instructions are converted into the
              machine code necessary for the computer to perform its tasks.
